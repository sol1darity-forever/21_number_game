21 Number Game

The 21 Number Game is a simple Python command-line game where you play against the computer. Starting from 1, each player can say one, two, or three consecutive numbers per turn. The player who says 21 loses.
The computer follows a smart strategy using multiples of 4 (4, 8, 12, 16, 20) to force the player into saying 21, making it very difficult to beat.

	2.	Choose whether you or the computer goes first.
